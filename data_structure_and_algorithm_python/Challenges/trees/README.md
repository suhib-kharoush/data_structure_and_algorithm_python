# Trees
- A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children generally referred as left child and right child.

- binary search tree: is a collection of nodes arranged in a way where they maintain BST properties.

### Challenge:
- Create a BinaryTree class.
- Create a BinarySearchTree class.
- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

### Approach & Efficiency:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

### API:
- per_order return an array of collection from depth first traversal.
- in_order return an array of collection from in_order depth first traversal.
- post_order return an array of collection from post_order depth first traversal.
